@seankhliao is in the **mono**repo phase of life

Why have a dozen repos when everything can live together in harmony?
No more changes that span across all the repos when you cange one thing,
it's just one change now.

## layout

The top level should be reserved for global config files,
and code is partitioned primarily by purpose / language.

<!--
## projects

These are autogenerated summaries of the various projects within this monorepo.

<!-- monodocgen start -->
<!-- monodocgen end -->

## other repos

Some code just doesn't suit living in here,
in particular the public repos:

- [seankhliao/config][repoconfig] basically a git repo repo of `~/.config`
- [seankhliao/seankhliao][reposeankhliao] the readme that shows up on my github profile page, has to be its own repo
- [seankhliao/seankhliao.github.io][repogithubio] just a redirect, also has to be its own repo
- [erred/][githuberred] all of my old repos
